Version 0.11 (17 Sep 92)

* Back-references to nonexistent subexpressions, as in the r.e. `abc\1',
  are always invalid.  Previously, they could match the literal digit,
  e.g., the stated r.e. might have matched `abc1'.

* Empty subexpressions are always valid (POSIX leaves this undefined).

* Simplified rules for ^ and $ being anchors.

* One minor speedup (rewriting the C procedure `pop_failure_point' as a
  macro again).

* Bug fixes involving:
    - Declarations in regex.h and non-ANSI compilers.
    - Bracket expressions with characters between 0x80-0xff.
    - Memory leak in re_match_2 on systems requiring `alloca (0)' to
      free alloca'd storage.

* Test and documentation files moved into subdirectories.

Version 0.10 (9 Sep 92)

* `obscure_syntax' is now called `re_default_syntax'.

* `re_comp's return type is no longer `const', for compatibility with BSD.

* POSIX syntaxes now include as much functionality as possible
  (consistent with the standard).

* Compilation conditionals normalized to what the rest of GNU is
  migrating towards these days.

* Bug fixes involving:
    - Ranges with characters between 0x80 and 0xff, e.g., [\001-\377].
    - `re_compile_fastmap' and the sequence `.*\n'.
    - Intervals with exact counts, e.g., a{5}.

* Changed distribution to use a standard Makefile, install the info
  files, use a configure script, etc.

Version 0.9

* The longest match was not always chosen: `a*|ab' didn't match `aab'.
