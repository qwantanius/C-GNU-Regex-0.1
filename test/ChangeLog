        * xmalloc.c (xmalloc): use char *, not void *, as some compilers
          bomb out on the latter.

        * Makefile.in (LOADLIBES): use LIBS instead, as that what's
          Autoconf wants to define.

        * other.c: remove tests for ^/$ around newlines.

        * fileregex.c (main): call re_search_2 instead of re_search.

        * Makefile.in (regex.o): make target dregex.o, so VPATH doesn't
          find ../regex.o.
